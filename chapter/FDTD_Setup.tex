This is a chapter about the proper setup of all necessary FDTD parameter.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FDTD

\texttt{FDTD}    is a structure in Matlab to describe some parameters of the algorithm FDTD. It contains 3 fields: \phantomsection \label{para:FDTD} %\hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}}
       \end{myindentpar}
All fields and  their elements  are showed in the figure \ref{fig:Structure FDTD}


  \def\svgwidth{0.8\textwidth}
   \input{svg/FDTD_structure.eps_tex} % this file is from inkscape. saved as with option  omit text and in latex. it has been modified for links.

Most of these parameters should be assigned with respective functions in MATLAB before a simulation is run in OpenEMS.  Firstly the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} should be initiated(see section \ref{sec:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}), then  \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} (see section \ref{sec:FDTD_Excitation}) and \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}} (see section \ref{sec:BC}) are set up in the structure. %\hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} has other advanced  parameters of \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, such as the type of the coordinates system,  criteria for ending the simulation and so on.

\section{Attributes of FDTD} \label{sec:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}
\phantomsection \label{para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}
This section shows how to initiate a \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} with some given attributes. 

\section{Excitation signal setup} \label{sec:FDTD_Excitation}
An excitation  is a source of the  electric magnetic field. It can be  an electrical field intensity E or an magnetic field intensity H. And  in OpenEMS, each excitation can be considered as a composition  of two parts -- a signal of  time or  frequency as well as  a distribution or an application in the space. The first part is called excitation signal here. And in Matlab it is defined as one field of the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, which is named as \texttt{Excitation}. \phantomsection \label{para:Excitation} \\%\hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} 

\hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} might include the following  subfields\footnote{It depends on the type of the signal}: 
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \texttt{FDTD.Excitation.ATTRIBUTE.Type} \\ 
	      \texttt{FDTD.Excitation.ATTRIBUTE.f0} \\ 
	      \texttt{FDTD.Excitation.ATTRIBUTE.fc} \\
              \texttt{FDTD.Excitation.ATTRIBUTE.Function}
       \end{myindentpar}

 Following subsections are  about how to set up an \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} as a Gaussian pulse, a sinousoidal signal or other customs excitation signals.\footnote{How to apply the \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  to any given space(meshes or grids) is showed in the section \ref{sect-Primitives}.} See the functions for setting the excitation signals:
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \hyperref[func:SetGaussExcite]{\texttt{SetGaussExcite(FDTD,f0,fc)}} \\ 
	      \hyperref[func:SetSinusExcite]{\texttt{SetSinusExcite(FDTD,f0)}}\\ 
	      \hyperref[func:SetCustomExcite]{\texttt{SetCustomExcite(FDTD,f0,funcStr)}}
       \end{myindentpar}
The excitation signals in MATLAB are all defined as  functions of frequency, since signals in time domain or frequency domain can be transformed into each other.   More Details are showed in the follwing subsections \ref{subsec:Gaussian pulse}, \ref{subsec:Sinousoidal signal} and \ref{subsec:Other excitation signals}

\info{One  simulation has one excitation signal. 
And if many excitation signals are involved in a case, superposition prinziple can be utilized to  attain the equivalent simulation.\\
\texttt{FDTD.ATTRIBUTE.f\_max} will be also assigned  at the same time while using these functions.}

    \subsection{Gaussian pulse} \label{subsec:Gaussian pulse}
If $f_0$ is a modulated frequency and $f_c$ is a bandwidth between  two cutoff frequencies $f_0-f_c/2$ and  $f_0+f_c/2$ at -5dB, then a time domain gaussian signal (a pure gaussian signal modulated by a cosinusoidal signal)
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_time}
 f(t)=cos[2\pi f_0(t-t_0)]e^{-{\big(\frac{t-t_0}{\frac{t0}{3}}\big)}^2}, \quad \text{for } t>0 \text{ and }t_0=\frac{9}{2\pi f_c}
\end{equation}
can be expressed  in frequency domain as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_freq}
F(f)=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{\pi}f_c}e^{-j\frac{9f}{f_c}}e^{-{\big(\frac{f-f_0}{\frac{2f_c}{3}}\big)}^2},\quad \text{for } f>0 .
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory} shows an instance of Gaussian inpulse from expressions \ref{equ:GussianSignal_time} and \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}.

	  Boundary conditions (BC) are necessary for solving the  Maxwell's equations by FDTD. They can limit the computation in a finite space but ataining the same solution just as in a infinite one.  \\
	  The following equations are the general boundary conditions at an arbitrary interface of two medium. And there can be  charges (denoted as charge density $\rho_s$) or  currents (denoted as surface electric current density $\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s$ and  surface magnetic current density $\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s$) at the interface:
	  %%%%% BC EQ
	      \begin{eqnarray}
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{D}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{D}}_1) &=&\rho_s  \\
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{B}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{B}}_1) &=&0  \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{E}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{E}}_1) &=&-\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{H}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{H}}_1) &=&\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s
		  \label{eq:General boundary conditions}
	      \end{eqnarray}

    \subsubsection{Four particularly useful types of boundary conditions in OpenEMS}\label{subsubsec:Four particularly usefull BC}
	Under some special given conditions or assumptions, the boundary conditions(\ref{eq:General boundary conditions}) have  respective forms and they are convenient for the most simulations. These BC are called as perfect electric conductor (\textbf{PEC}), perfect magnetic conductor (\textbf{PMC}), \textbf{MUR} absorbing boundary condition and perfectly matched layer (\textbf{PML}) absorbing boundary condition. More details of these four types of BC are  given in the following subsections (\ref{subsec:PEC}, \ref{subsec:PMC}, \ref{subsec:MUR} and  \ref{subsec:PML}). And the types of these BC are represented as a field of the structure  \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} in MATLAB. And it's named as \texttt{BoundaryCond}. \phantomsection \label{para:BoundaryCond}

    \subsubsection{The condition for application of PEC}
    In practice, this BC can be applied where the media  is \textbf{good conductor(e.g., metal)}, because the good conductor can often be seen as nearly lossless(perfect). So condition for using PEC can be summarized as either
    \begin{itemize}
    \item one media is good conductor(e.g., metal) \\
    or
    \item $\sigma\rightarrow\infty$.
    \end{itemize}
