\chapter{FDTD Parameters Setup}\label{chap:FDTD Parameter Setup}
This is a chapter about  settings of  some parameters for FDTD.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FDTD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Most of these settings can be realized through  assignment statement of a variable \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} in Matlab.  Because a simulation using FDTD needs many parameters, the variable \texttt{FDTD} is defined for these parameters as a structure including 3 fields: \phantomsection \label{para:FDTD} %\hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}}
       \end{myindentpar}

Some functions have been defined for user to  assign values to the parameters in \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}. These functions are for initiation of \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} (section \ref{sec:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}), settings of  excitations (section \ref{sec:FDTD_Excitation}), settings of boundary conditions (section \ref{sec:BC}).
% Most of these parameters should be assigned with respective functions in MATLAB before a simulation is run in OpenEMS. And this process can be completed step by step. Firstly the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} should be initiated, then  \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  and \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}} (see section \ref{sec:BC}) are set up in the structure.%\hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} has other advanced  parameters of \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, such as the type of the coordinates system,  criteria for ending the simulation and so on.
